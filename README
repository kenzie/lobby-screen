Lobby Screen
============

An initialization web page that shows a splash screen, loads a remote
web page via ajax, then transitions from splash screen to remote page
content. If the remote page is inaccessible it will be retried at
regular intervals.

For use as a locally loaded page on a Raspberry Pi setup for digital
signage in an arena lobby in an attempt to prevent showing 404 or
similar errors to the public.
